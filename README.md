**Text-to-Image Generation for Arabic (TTIGA)**

**Overview:**
TTIGA is a cutting-edge project aimed at generating images from Arabic language textual descriptions. 
It employs advanced machine learning techniques, including transformer-based models and GANs, to accurately represent Arabic text in visual form.
